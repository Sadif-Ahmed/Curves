# Curves

## 📘 Project Overview
**Curves** is a project focused on the mathematical visualization and rendering of curves using **C++**. It involves the generation, manipulation, and visualization of different types of curves, such as Bézier curves, B-splines, and other parametric curves. The project demonstrates advanced programming concepts like **computer graphics**, **mathematical modeling**, and **curve interpolation techniques**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Curve Visualization**: Generate and visualize different types of curves (e.g., Bézier curves, B-splines) in a graphical environment.
- **Custom Input**: Users can define custom control points to create unique curves.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Allows dynamic interaction and manipulation of control points.
- **Mathematical Computation**: Implements curve algorithms and interpolation techniques.

## 📂 Project Structure
The main components of the repository are organized as follows:
```
├── src                  # Source code for the C++ files
├── assets               # Optional assets like images or supporting files
├── build                # Compiled binaries and executables
├── README.md            # Project documentation
└── Makefile             # File to build and compile the project
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: Custom 2D/3D graphics rendering using C++ graphics libraries
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Parametric curves, Bézier curves, B-splines, and interpolation techniques
- **Development Tools**: GCC compiler, Makefile for project build automation

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed before running the project:
- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: To compile the C++ source code.
- **Make**: To run the Makefile and build the project.

## 📥 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sadif-Ahmed/Curves.git
   cd Curves
   ```
2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. **Run the Visualization**:
   ```bash
   ./curves
   ```

## 📚 Usage Instructions
1. Launch the visualization tool by running the `./curves` executable.
2. Use the interactive interface to add, move, or remove control points.
3. Observe how the curve updates in real time based on the control points.
4. Experiment with different types of curves, such as Bézier or B-splines, if supported.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- **Additional Curve Types**: Support for more advanced curve types like NURBS.
- **Interactive UI Enhancements**: Allow drag-and-drop for control points.
- **3D Curve Visualization**: Extend support to visualize curves in a 3D space.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Improve the efficiency of curve rendering and computations.
